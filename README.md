# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project is an implementation of a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset contains a total of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 transactions are fraudulent.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


# Results
The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 99.9%, a precision of 90.6%, a recall of 77.6%, and an F1 score of 83.5%. These results indicate that the model is able to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

# Future Work
Future work on this project could involve the following:

Using more advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the model.
Exploring the use of deep learning techniques for credit card fraud detection.
Integrating the model into a real-time credit card fraud detection system.

# Credits
